`Ask me guiding questions to help me find the mistake myself.`

## Process Help

`Help me build [thing]. Break it into small steps.`

`Act like my coach—ask what I’d do first, then suggest what the next step could be.`
### Feedback

`Tell me one thing I did well in this code, and one small thing I can improve. Don’t rewrite it.`

`Give me feedback as if you’re my mentor reviewing my work, but keep it short and focused.`

### Practice

`Quiz me on [topic] with one small question at a time.`

`Give me a small coding challenge on [topic], then review my solution.`

### General Tips

State your goal → (“I want to understand/debug/practice…”)

Set boundaries → (“Don’t give full code / only one step / ask me first…”)

Engage actively → Answer questions, reflect, and try before asking for more.
